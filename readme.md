## Getting Started

### End points
1. Register a New User :
     ```sh
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "username": "user",
    "password": "password"
    }'
    
   Expected Response :
   ```sh
    {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "user",
    "password": "$2a$10$...",
    "roles": [
        {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "ROLE_USER"
        }
    ]
    }
2. Authenticate the User and Receive a JWT:
     ```sh

    "password": "password"
    }'

    Expected Response :
    ```sh
    {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9..."
    }

3.Access a Protected Resource Using the JWT : 
    ```sh
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/hello \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9..."
